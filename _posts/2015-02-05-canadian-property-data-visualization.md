title: Check Back This Weekend
---

A couple months ago I bumped into an old friend at a Christmas party and we got chatting about what we're working on these days. He mentioned that he's been looking after the technology at a Y-Combinator funded startup called [Priceonomics](http://priceonomics.com/) that crawls and gathers information available on the web. And as a side project, he'd been gathering the housing prices for a number of Canadian cities for the last 9 months or so. Of course, I asked if there was any chance I take a look at some of this data, and luckily, he obliged!

The data itself tracked individual house prices over time for each city, which opened up a number of possible ways to visualize it.

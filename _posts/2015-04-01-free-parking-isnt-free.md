title: Free Parking Isn't Free
---

Ask your local jaded economist how to get more or less of something, and they’re give you a simple answer: if you want more, subsidize it; if you want less, tax it. Well, until yesterday, the Government of New Brunswick was casting a huge vote in favour of one of their favourite job-creating commodities: asphalt. Not the “making roads makes work” kind though (that’s a different story), but the kind that paves over the limited amount of land the province’s cities have at their disposal. Yes, we’re talking about boring, old surface parking.

By allowing government employees - who make up more than half of the employed population in the province - to park for free, we were knowingly or not transforming our cities and dramatically reducing their ability to pay for themselves in the long-run. You don’t need to look much further than a simple map of the surface parking available in the province’s capital city to see the kind of impact that this approach has had:

Every red block you see is a space that could be something else. If a flat parking lot exists, it means that that is the most valuable use of that land that anybody could think of. And when you don’t even charge for it, you imply that it is practically worthless. Consider instead if we took the total square footage of parking you see on that map, stacked it vertically in the form of paid parking garages distributed throughout the city, and replaced those parking lots with low-rise apartments or even regular homes or space for business. Not only would you be generating a lot more tax revenue for the limited downtown space that you have, you’d start to approach a density of downtown dwellers that would keep a small city from shutting down at 6PM in the evening.

And we haven’t even talked about the social and health impacts of reducing our dependency on cars. A 2014 study by the province’s Urban & Community Studies Institute found that 9 in 10 people in the province commute by car - something that is widely recognized to be one of the most mentally stressful acts a human can perform. And the trend doesn’t look like it’s getting any better. One of the few stats that is going up in the province is the number of vehicle registrations. In fact, it’s slowly by surely converging with the total adult population:

    <script data-plotly="Brideau:55" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>

Think about that. That isn’t the number of vehicles compared to the number of households. That’s the number of cars compared to the total adult population of the province. All in, the average cost of owning a mid-sized car for a year is about $8000. This means that the population of NB is spending about $4.2 Billion dollars per year just to get around day-to-day. That’s money that could be spent in much more effective ways.

Finally, consider the positive impact this may have on the way the province’s cities are actually designed. Consider the last time you went for a casual walk when the weather was nice (and if you’re in NB, you might need to go back in your memory a bit). Where did you go? Did you go for a nice stroll next to your local parking lot, or along a nearby 4-lane road? I can almost guarantee you didn’t. The human brain is wired to hate those environments. They’re noisy, dangerous and boring. Still, for some reason the province’s capital has three roads goings directly through the middle of it that are classified as provincial highways and are pegged for expansion. (Ever notice on Google Maps that Queen, Brunswick and Regent are coloured yellow? That’s why.)

The plain fact is that you can’t design something you don’t truly understand or relate to. If what you relate to is being annoyed by not being able to park within a 15 second walk of wherever your destination is or being able to get home in 7 minutes instead of 9, I can guarantee you that you’ll know how to design a damn fine parking lot and high-speed road. If your daily experience involves avoiding cars in crosswalks, waiting for the next bus in -30 degree weather, or generally enjoying the public space provided by your city (that’s why you live there, right?), you’ll start considering ways to improve each of those. And if you happen to be a civil servant that has the power to change any of those, engaging directly in any of those activities will allow you to relate to others that do, and will make your decisions on those matters better. While a small step in that direction, phasing out free parking for all GNB employees is a great way to get that started.

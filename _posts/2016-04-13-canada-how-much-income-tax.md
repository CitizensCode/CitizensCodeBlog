Admittedly, the Canadian government hasn't been the best at communicating the logistics of the operation, but thanks to a leaked document titled ["Operation Syrian Refugees" ](http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/500k-federal-ad-campaign-to-tout-refugee-plan-as-a-national-project-document-reveals), we can start to piece together the details.

Since their goal is to fly 900 people on 3 planes, they'll need a plane that can seat 300, and it turns out there are a number of those, one being the Boeing 767. As a bonus, it has [a flight range of 7,130 to 11,825 km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_767), so it could potentially even do the trip in a single flight (not that it would _have_ to, but it could).
